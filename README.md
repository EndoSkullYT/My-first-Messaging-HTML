# Simple GitHub Chat (Simulation)

This project is a basic HTML file that simulates a chat interface. It allows a user to enter a username and type messages, which are then displayed in a chat area.

**Important:** This is *not* a real-time, multi-user chat application. It is a client-side simulation intended for demonstration purposes. Each user will only see their own messages in their own browser.

## Features

*   **Username Input:**  Prompts the user to enter a username before using the "chat."
*   **Message Input:**  Allows the user to type and send messages.
*   **Chat Area:**  Displays the messages entered by the user.
*   **Simple Styling:**  Basic CSS for a clean and easy-to-understand interface.
*   **GitHub Pages Friendly:**  Can be easily hosted on GitHub Pages as it requires no server-side code.

## Limitations

*   **Not a Real-Time Chat:** Messages are *not* shared between different users or browser sessions.
*   **No Multi-User Support:** Only one user's messages are displayed in their own browser.
*   **No Persistence:** Messages are not saved and are lost when the page is refreshed.
*   **Client-Side Only:**  Everything runs in the browser. There is no server involved.
*   **No User List:** There is no indication of who else is "online."

## How to Use

1.  **Download or Clone:** Download the `index.html` file or clone this repository to your local machine.
2.  **Open in Browser:** Open the `index.html` file in any web browser.
3.  **Enter Username:** Enter a username in the provided input field and click "Join Chat."
4.  **Type Messages:** Type your messages in the message input field and click "Send."
5.  **View Messages:** Your messages will appear in the chat area.

## Hosting on GitHub Pages

This project is designed to be easily hosted on GitHub Pages:

1.  **Create a Repository:** Create a new repository on GitHub.
2.  **Upload the File:** Upload the `index.html` file to your repository.
3.  **Enable GitHub Pages:**
    *   Go to your repository's "Settings" tab.
    *   Scroll down to the "GitHub Pages" section.
    *   Under "Source," select the branch you uploaded the file to (usually `main` or `master`).
    *   GitHub Pages will then build and deploy your site.
4.  **Access the Site:** GitHub Pages will provide you with a URL where you can access your site (e.g., `https://your-username.github.io/your-repository-name/`).

## Contributing

This is a very simple project, but contributions are welcome! If you have suggestions for improvements (e.g., better styling), feel free to submit a pull request.  However, please note that adding true real-time functionality is beyond the scope of this project as it is intended to be a client-side demonstration.
